# fanofpixel's Multi Tower Kit

A copy of fanofpixel's Multi Tower Kit as a repository.

For advice, see the [original template] and [the manual].

***I DID NOT MAKE THIS.*** This repository only serves for other tower games
that wants to use Rojo and external tooling - this does not include Potentially
Fire Pillars as we use our own kit.

Eventually, this repository will have a refactored Multi Tower Kit that is
easier to extend and modify. This includes fixing up the ancient scripts the
JToH developers wrote.

Generated by [Rojo] 7.4.4.

## Getting Started

To build the place from scratch, use:

```bash
rojo build -o "mtk.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `mtk.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

For more help, check out [the Rojo documentation].
